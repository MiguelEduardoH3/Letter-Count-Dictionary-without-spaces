# Letter-Count-Dictionary-without-spaces
Use a dictionary to count the frequency of letters in the input string. 
Only letters should be counted, not blank spaces, numbers, or punctuation. Upper case should be considered the same as lower case. 
For example, count_letters("This is a sentence.") should return {'t': 2, 'h': 1, 'i': 2, 's': 3, 'a': 1, 'e': 3, 'n': 2, 'c': 1}.
